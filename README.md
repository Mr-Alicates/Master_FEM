This is a small application to aid the teaching of the finite element method. 

It allows the users to learn how the finite element method is used to calculate the displacements of a 3D "space truss" structure.

Created as my master's dissertation for the Master's Degree in Computer-Aided Integrated Manufacturing and Design (MUDFIAC) at the Politechnic University of Valencia (UPV)

Work in progress. Current version is in alpha state and code needs lots of improvement.
The idea is to release the code as open source.
